\chapter{Reset Domain Crossing}

\section{Reset Domains \& Metastability}

Consider a circuit with many different flip-flops. We define a \keyword{reset domain} as the set of any flip flops that share the same reset signal $rstn$.
\begin{bullets}
	\item The reset signal guarantees that the data output is 0 during its \keyword{assertion}.
	\item Metastability can only occur during the \keyword{deassertion} of a reset signal.
\end{bullets}
 
There are a couple methods to actually fix this, and the first one is the same as its CDC counterpart
\begin{bullets}
	\item $n$-flop synchronizer
	\item
