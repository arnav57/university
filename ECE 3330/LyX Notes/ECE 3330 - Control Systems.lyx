\begin_layout Section
Control Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
\color brown
Control System 
\series default
\color inherit
is a system consisting of subsystems and processes assembled for the purposes
 of obtaining some 
\emph on
desired output
\emph default
 (with desired 
\emph on
specifications
\emph default
), all given some 
\emph on
specified input
\emph default
.
 This is a very confusing and high level definition, but it will make sense
 as we do more and more work on this topic.
 For now, a quick example of a control system would be a rotary potentiometer
 controlling the height of a platform.
 How far we turn our potentiometer is our 
\emph on
specified input
\emph default
, for which we want to encode the height of our platform (our 
\emph on
desired output
\emph default
) But upon turning the knob, how will the platform respond? slowly? quickly?
 accelerate fast? accelerate slow? These are the 
\emph on
specifcations
\emph default
 for our control systems, and we would design it to our liking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Open-loop & Closed-loop
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A control system can fall under two categories, 
\series bold
\color brown
open-loop
\series default
\color inherit
 and 
\series bold
\color brown
closed-loop
\series default
\color inherit
.
 The only difference between these types of system is the presence of something
 called 
\series bold
\color brown
feedback
\series default
\color inherit
, which is a pathway that connects a node further down the line, to one
 earlier in the line - called a feedback loop.
 Open-loop systems have no feedback loops, while closed-loop systems contain
 at least one feedback loop.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

An example of each is given below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Toaster oven (open-loop) - how much you turn the time knob determines how
 long it toasts for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cruise control (closed-loop) - checks current speed and compares it to desired
 speed adjusting in the correct direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Frequency Domain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step in every control design case is to use the laws of physics
 and engineering to generate a 
\series bold
\color brown
differential equation
\series default
\color inherit
 that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs of a system.
 We often find working with differential equations unwieldy and unintuitive,
 thus we convert them into algebraic equations via the 
\series bold
\color brown
laplace transform
\series default
\color inherit
.
 This chapter will be primarly creating a model for the following rotational
 mechanical system, modelling how the output angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 changes with respect to a changing torque 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic Kinematics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our system is shown above in Figure 2.1, it consists of a torsional (rotational)
 spring with constant 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, a mass with inertia 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

, and a rotational viscous damping of some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 We can start to generate the differential equation by writing newton's
 second law for rotational kinematics.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum\tau=I\ddot{\theta}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The complete list of torques on the system are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Input Torque - 
\begin_inset Formula $+\tau$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Torsional spring - 
\begin_inset Formula $-K\theta$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Viscous Damping - 
\begin_inset Formula $-D\dot{\theta}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means we can write newton's second law for this system as follows,
 which generates a (generally non-homogenous) second order linear ordinary
 differential equation in equation 2.1.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau\left(t\right)-K\theta-D\dot{\theta}=J\ddot{\theta}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau\left(t\right)=J\ddot{\theta}+D\dot{\theta}+K\theta
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Transfer Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to better understand and interpret what is actually happening in
 equation 2.1, we take the laplace transform of it to convert it into an
 algebraic equation in the frequency domain.
 This lets us understand how the inputs are mapped to outputs via something
 called the
\series bold
\color brown
 transfer function
\series default
\color inherit
, which is defined as the ratio between output and input, 
\begin_inset Formula $T\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\text{output}}{\text{input}}=T\left(s\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Upon taking the laplace transform of equation 2.1 (neglecting intial conditions),
 we arrive at the following transfer function for our general rotational-mechani
cal system in the complex-frequency domain, shown in equation 2.2.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\theta\left(s\right)}{\tau\left(s\right)}=\frac{1}{Js^{2}+Ds+K}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Suppose we were interested in a different output though, consider obtaining
 the output for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 the angular velocity of the motor.
 We can easily find this from Equation 2.2 by considering the relationship
 between omega and theta in the time domain.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{\theta}\left(t\right)=\omega\left(t\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We know that differentiating in the time-domain is the same as multiplying
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in the frequency domain, thus we can write this relationship in the s-domain
 and generate an expression for omega in terms of theta.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s\theta\left(s\right)=\omega\left(s\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\theta\left(s\right)=\frac{1}{s}\omega\left(s\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We can plug this into equation 2.2 to get our desired transfer function for
 omega in terms of tau in Equation 2.3.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\omega\left(s\right)}{\tau\left(s\right)}=\frac{s}{Js^{2}+Ds+K}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The Electric Motor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After modelling a general rotiation-mechanical system in chapter 2, we will
 be modelling an electromechanical system - the electric (induction) motor.
 We will being by modeling the electrical circuit, and then combining that
 with our model from chapter 2 to get the model of an electric motor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Electric Motor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the circuit in Figure 3.1, It is an extremely basic model electric
 motor circuit model.
 consisting of a circuit, and a rotational mechanical system from the motor's
 rotating head.
 Before we start modeling, we will need some background information about
 motors.
 It is common to model off some background information in the real world
 as well.
 Here are some interesting relations describing the angular velocity and
 torque of a motor, given a machine constant and the motor voltage and current.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega_{m}=K_{m}v_{b}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau_{m}=K_{m}i_{a}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's start by writing KVL for the circuit.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{a}-v_{b}=R_{a}i_{a}+L_{a}\frac{di_{a}}{dt}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Taking laplace of both sides and generating the transfer function gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{i_{a}}{v_{a}-v_{b}}=\frac{1}{R+sL}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

From the provided formulae in section 3.1, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i_{a}=\frac{1}{K_{m}}\tau_{m}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

And substitue this into our circuit's transfer function to obtain a transfer
 function for motor torque, with respect to voltage difference.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\tau_{m}}{v_{a}-v_{b}}=\frac{K_{m}}{R+sL}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We can then use the transfer function for a rotational-mechanical system
 we derived earlier in chapter 2, to relate torque to an output velocity.
 
\emph on
Note: 
\emph default
In this system there is no spring, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $K=0$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\omega_{m}\left(s\right)}{v_{a}-v_{b}}=\frac{K_{m}}{R+sL}\cdot\frac{1}{Js+D}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is the complete model of an electric motor.
 We can introduce some simplification like ignoring the 
\begin_inset Formula $sL$
\end_inset

 term as inductance values (
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

) are generally extremely small.
 Doing some algebra and ultimately we get something of the form, where 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 are calculable through the systems unique parameters (resistance, inertia,
 damping, etc.).
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\omega_{m}\left(s\right)}{v_{a}-v_{b}}=\frac{K}{s\left(s+a\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Time Domain Response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have learned how to obtain the characteristics of a system,
 and model it in the 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

-domain.
 We should begin our study on important characteristics of a system: transient
 response and steady-state errors.
 In this note we look at the time domain response (transient response) of
 first and second order systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Characteristics of Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Systems (in the context of control systems), refer to the transfer function.
 Systems in general can be written in terms of their numerator and denominator
 polynomials.
 The order of a system refers to the number of poles it posesses (degree
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 function)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G\left(s\right)=\frac{b_{m}s^{m}+b_{m-1}s^{m-1}+\dots+b_{0}}{a_{n}s^{n}+a_{n-1}s^{n-1}+\dots+a_{0}}=\frac{N\left(s\right)}{D\left(s\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We can also formally define the zeroes and poles of a system.
 Zeroes are values that make the function equal to 0, where poles are values
 where the function goes to plus or minus infinity.
 Formally, we can write the following definitions.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The system 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 has a 
\series bold
\color brown
zero
\series default
\color inherit
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

 if:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(x\right)|_{x=x_{0}}=0
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The system 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 has a pole at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{p}$
\end_inset

 if :
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(x\right)|_{x=x_{p}}=\pm\infty
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For our system 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

, This means that the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 determines its zeroes, and that the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 determines its poles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Responses of a System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
\color brown
step response
\series default
\color inherit
 of a system can be determined by applying a step input to the transfer
 function, and determining the output in the time-domain.
 For first order systems, this will generate two terms called the 
\series bold
\color brown
forced response
\series default
\color inherit
, and the 
\series bold
\color brown
natural response
\series default
\color inherit
.
 We can also find various other response of a system, for example the impulse
 response, and the ramp response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
System Representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previously we studied transfer functions of control systems and how we relate
 the input and the ouput.
 We can now represent this graphically through the use of block diagrams.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C\left(s\right)=G\left(s\right)\cdot R\left(s\right)
\]

\end_inset

\series bold

\series bold

, it is quite obvious to see that their total transfer function is a product

Parallel Form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When multiple block's outputs are 
\series bold
\color brown
connected in parallel
\series default
\color inherit
 and joined through a summing junction, The equivalent transfer function
 is the sum of the transfer functions connected in parallel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Signal Flow Graphs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can write block diagrams in a different way through 
\series bold
\color brown
signal flow graphs
\series default
\color inherit
 which are nodes connected through gains.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Mason's Rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often we can derive the transfer functions for simple systems algebraically,
 or through equations 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 derived in Chapter 1.
 However, this might not always be feasible.
 For extremely complicated systems we follow 
\series bold
\color brown
Mason's Rules
\series default
\color inherit
, which help us get right to the transfer function for the input of a system
 and any output we desire.
 Consider the diagram below.
 Throughout this chapter we will be using mason's rules to derive the transfer
 function for the signal flow diagram in Figure 2.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mason's Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mason's rule states that the transfer function 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 between the specified input on the diagram 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

, and some output point we choose 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Can be found through the following equation.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G\left(s\right)=\frac{\sum_{k}T_{k}\Delta_{k}}{\Delta}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

= number of forward paths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}$
\end_inset

 = the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th forward path gain

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{k}$
\end_inset

 = loop gains after removing the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th forward path
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This makes no sense, so lets define these terms, and then derive the transfer
 function in Figure 2.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

 more than once, all while following the direction of signal flow.

\begin_layout Standard
Lets start by determining the number of

forward paths
\series default
\color inherit
, in this case there is only one thus 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

.
 It's corresponding

forward path gain
\series default

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{1}G_{2}G_{3}G_{4}G_{5}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Next we should find the 
\series bold

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{LG}=(1)+(2)+(3)+(4)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next lets take the nontouching loops two at a time.
 We can take loops 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and then 2 and 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\left(G_{2}H_{1}\right)\left(G_{4}H_{2}\right)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\left(G_{2}H_{1}\right)\left(G_{7}H_{4}\right)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\left(G_{4}H_{2}\right)\left(G_{7}H_{4}\right)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{LG-2}=(1)(2)+(1)(3)+(2)(3)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next we take nontouching loops three at a time.
 We can take loops 1 2 and 3 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\left(G_{2}H_{1}\right)\left(G_{4}H_{2}\right)\left(G_{7}H_{4}\right)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{LG-3}=(1)(2)(3)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are only three nontouching loops, thus every other term in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 will be zero.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta=1-\left(\text{LG}\right)+\left(\text{LG-2}\right)-\left(\text{LG-3}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Now we can find 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{k}$
\end_inset

, in this case 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{1}$
\end_inset

by removing forward path 1, and then taking the delta of the remaining graph.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta_{1}=1-G_{7}H_{4}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Thus we can write the whole transfer function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G\left(s\right)=\frac{T_{1}\Delta_{1}}{\Delta}=\frac{\left(G_{1}G_{2}G_{3}G_{4}G_{5}\right)\left(1-G_{7}H_{4}\right)}{1-\left(\text{LG}\right)+\left(\text{LG-2}\right)-\left(\text{LG-3}\right)}

The general form of a

 is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T\left(s\right)=\frac{A}{s+a}

\begin_layout Section
Step Response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can easily find the step response of a general first order system.
 Consider an output 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, and some input 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 To find the step response, we set 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(s\right)=s^{-1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\left(s\right)=\frac{A}{s+a}C\left(s\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\left(s\right)=\frac{A}{s\left(s+a\right)}=\frac{k_{1}}{s}+\frac{k_{2}}{s+a}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r\left(t\right)=k_{1}+k_{2}e^{-at}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We can easily solve for coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{2}$
\end_inset

to obtain the following step response
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r\left(t\right)=\frac{A}{a}-\frac{A}{a}e^{-at}=\frac{A}{a}\left(1-e^{-at}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Time Constant, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The
\series bold
\color brown
 time constant (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

)
\series default
\color inherit
 is a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 that will provide a 1 into the argument of the exponential terms.
 The only exponential term present here is 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(-at\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus setting values of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 equal to the reciprocal of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 will always generate 1 for the argument.
 The time constant is helpful because it helps us evaluate the step response
 of a first order system, as the output will rise to 63% of the final value
 within one time-constant, and 95% of the final value at 3 time-constants.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau=\frac{1}{a}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Initial Speed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The
\series bold
\color brown
 initial speed
\series default
\color inherit
 of a first order system's step response can be derived by differentiating
 the expression, and evaluating it at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
 We can see that the intial slope (speed) is equal to the number 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 in the numerator of the transfer function.
 A system is said to be faster than another system if it has an intial speed
 greater than that of the other.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{A}{a}\left(1-e^{-at}\right)\right]|_{t=0}=\frac{A}{a}\left[a\right]=A
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Rise Time, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{r}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
\color brown
rise time (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{r}$
\end_inset

)
\series default
\color inherit
 of a system is defined as the time it takes for the system to go from 10%
 to 90% of its final value.
 We can easily find this for the general first order system.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{r}=t_{90}-t_{10}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It is trivial to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{90}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{10}$
\end_inset

 analytically.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{90}=-\frac{\ln\left(0.1\right)}{a}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{10}=-\frac{\ln\left(0.9\right)}{a}
\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Thus we can write it in terms of the value 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, or the time constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{r}=\frac{1}{a}\left(\ln\left(0.9\right)-\ln\left(0.1\right)\right)=\frac{2.2}{a}=2.2\tau
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Settling Time, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The settling time (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}$
\end_inset

) of a system is defined as the time it takes for the system to reach, and
 stay within 2% of its final value.
 In general this is also trivial to determine analytically.
 We can write it in terms of the value 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, or the time-constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
aT_{s}=-\ln\left(0.02\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{s}=\frac{3.91}{a}=3.91\tau
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Graph Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can determine (approximate) the transfer function from a plot of the
 step response for a first-order system.
 Here are the steps to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 it is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/a$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we can determine 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, because we have determined 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Chapter
Second Order Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we are going to study the time response of a
\series bold
\color brown
 second order system
\series default
\color inherit
.
 Unlike first order systems, a second ordersystem can exhibit a wide range
 of responses.
 Developing an understanding of first and second order systems are quite
 important within control engineering, as we can often represent higher
 order systems as consituents containing first order and second order terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Characteristic Form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A general second order system is represented as the following, and note
 that it represents a second order linear differential equation.
 Some of the variables in this equation are a bit strange at first, but
 lets define them and what they mean.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold

The Damping Factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset


\series default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T\left(s\right)=\frac{K}{s^{2}+2\zeta\omega_{0}s+\omega_{0}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Damping Regimes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to get a better understanding of the system we will have to solve
 the denominator to find the system poles.
 Via the quadratic formula we can write the following solutions for the
 poles
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s_{1,2}=-\zeta\omega_{0}\pm\omega_{0}\sqrt{\zeta^{2}-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Now it is quite obvious as to why we consider the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

, as the one that determines the behaviours of the system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Repeated, real roots - 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=1$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Distinct, real roots - 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta>1$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Distinct, complex roots - 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta<1$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case 1, we call the system 
\series bold
\color brown
crtitically damped
\series default
\color inherit
.
 In case 2 we call the system 
\series bold
\color brown
overdamped
\series default
\color inherit
.
 In case 3, we call the system 
\series bold
\color brown
underdamped
\series default
\color inherit
.
 This is because the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 determines the number of poles, and the type of each pole that we have.
 There is also the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=0$
\end_inset

 which is referred to as 
\series bold
\color brown
undamped
\series default
\color inherit
, however this still produces distinct complex roots, thus we deem it a
 
\emph on
special case
\emph default
 and stick it under case 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Undamped Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An 
\series bold
\color brown
undamped system arises when 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=0$
\end_inset

,
\series default
\color inherit
 and this results in a marginally unstable system that oscillates indefintely.
 Lets take a look at the step response for a general undamped system below.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T\left(s\right)=\frac{\omega_{0}^{2}}{s^{2}+\omega_{0}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The output 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 for some applied step response is shown below.
 We can also write partial fraction decomposition for this expression.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\left(s\right)=\frac{\omega_{0}^{2}}{s^{2}+\omega_{0}^{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{s}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\left(s\right)=\frac{k_{1}}{s}+\frac{k_{2}}{s-j\omega_{0}}+\frac{k_{3}}{s+j\omega_{0}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We can then take the inverse laplace of this expression and get the response
 in the time domain.
 Note that the 
\series bold
\color brown
natural frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset


\series default
\color inherit
 appears in the argument of the sinuosoidal terms, and that these are everpresen
t for all 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 This means that the output oscillates forever, even after reaching the
 final constant value.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r\left(t\right)=k_{1}+k_{2}\exp\left(j\omega_{0}t\right)+k_{3}\exp\left(-j\omega_{0}t\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r\left(t\right)=k_{1}+\left(k_{2}+k_{3}\right)\cos\left(\omega_{0}t\right)+\left(k_{2}-k_{3}\right)\sin\left(\omega_{0}t\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Underdamped Systems

\begin_layout Standard
An 
\series bold
\color brown
underdamped system arises when 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta<1$
\end_inset

,
\series default
\color inherit
 this results in a time-domain response with damped oscillations.
 Lets take a look at the general underdamped system below.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T\left(s\right)=\frac{\omega_{0}^{2}}{s^{2}+2\zeta\omega_{0}s+\omega_{0}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We can find poles of the denominator through the quadratic formula (equation
 3.1).
 Lets also remember that we are treating it as 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta<1$
\end_inset

 thus lets factor out a 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 as we expect to get complex roots.
 Let's also rewrite this complex thing into its real and complex parts 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{d}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{d}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{d}$
\end_inset

 represents the exponential damping of the oscillations and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{d}$
\end_inset

 represents the frequency of the damped oscillations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{1,2}=-\zeta\omega_{0}\pm j\sqrt{1-\zeta^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{1,2}=\sigma_{d}\pm j\omega_{d}
\]

\end_inset

The output 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 for some applied step response is shown below.
 We can also write partial fraction decomposition for this expression.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\left(s\right)=\frac{\omega_{0}^{2}}{s^{2}+2\zeta\omega_{0}s+\omega_{0}^{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{s}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\left(s\right)=\frac{k_{1}}{s}+\frac{k_{2}}{s-\sigma_{d}-j\omega_{d}}+\frac{k_{3}}{s-\sigma_{d}+j\omega_{d}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline

We can now take inverse laplace to get the following (disgusting expression)
 which we will have to simplify further.
 
\emph on
Note:
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{d}$
\end_inset

 is a negative number, hence these oscillations will eventually die out
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 We can also rewrite the final line in terms of a single sinusoid, which
 is omitted from this note, but can easily be done through basic phasor
 addition.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r\left(t\right)=k_{1}+k_{2}\exp\left(\left(\sigma_{d}+j\omega_{d}\right)t\right)+k_{3}k_{2}\exp\left(\left(\sigma_{d}-j\omega_{d}\right)t\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r\left(t\right)=k_{1}+\exp\left(\sigma_{d}t\right)\left(k_{2}\exp\left(j\omega_{d}t\right)+k_{3}\exp\left(-j\omega_{d}t\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r\left(t\right)=k_{1}+\exp\left(\sigma_{d}t\right)\left[\left(k_{2}+k_{3}\right)\cos\left(\omega_{d}t\right)+\left(k_{3}-k_{2}\right)\sin\left(\omega_{d}t\right)\right]

 that a second order system can possibly give.

The output 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

 for some applied step response is shown below, we can also easily factor
 this as follows to form the partial fraction decomposition.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\left(s\right)=\frac{\omega_{0}^{2}}{s^{2}+2\omega_{0}s+\omega_{0}^{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{s}

Taking inverse laplace give the following time domain response

 this results in a time-domain response with two time constants.
 Lets take a look at the general overdamped system below.
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

The output 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

 for some applied step response is shown below.
 We can find poles of the denominator through the quadratic formula (equation

\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$

\begin_layout Chapter
Stability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously discussed, we can easily find the time-domain response of
 a system through laplace transform methods.
 In this note we will be learning about stability and the criteria for a
 system to be stable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Types of Stability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within control systems, there exist three kinds of stability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Stable
\series default
\color inherit
 - A system is said to be stable if the natural response approaches zero
 as time approaches infinity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Unstable
\series default
\color inherit
 - A system is said to be unstable if the natural response grows without
 bound as time approaches infinity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\color brown
Marginally Stable
\series default
\color inherit
 - A system is said to be marginally stable if the natural response neither
 decays nor grows without bound, but remains constant or oscillates as time
 approaches infinity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Stability & Pole Location
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step to taking inverse laplace transforms is partial fraction
 decomposition.
 Recall that decomposition (s-domain) terms of the following form, always
 result in exponential time-domain terms.
 In order for a system to be stable, we require these exponential terms
 to be decaying terms (i.e their argument must be negative).
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{K}{s+z}\leftrightarrow K\exp\left(-zt\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In the case that 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is some complex value 
\begin_inset Formula $z=a+bj$
\end_inset

, we get a decaying sinusoid term, we require that these decaying exponentials
 also have negative arguments.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{K}{s+z}\leftrightarrow K\exp\left(-at\right)\cos\left(-bjt\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Both of these cases imply that 
\series bold
\color brown
stability demands that ALL poles in the transfer function lie on the LHS
 of the complex plane
\series default
\color inherit
.
 If all but one are on the LHS, the response will grow without bounds and
 become unstable.
 In all cases, this requires solving the denominator polynomial which isnt
 always very simple to do.
 Often times we wont even have to do this, the most basic criteria for stability
 is that all terms in the denominator's polynomial standard frm have the
 same sign, and that there are no missing terms.
 Which, isnt very helpful.
 For this reason we introduce something called the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion
 in the next chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Routh-Hurwitz Criterion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we will learn a method that yields stability information
 without needing to solve the denominator polynomial.
 Using this method we can tell 
\emph on
how many
\emph default
 poles lie on the LHS and RHS of the complex plane.
 (Note: that we say how many, not where.
 We cannot find their coordinates with this method).
 This method involves constructing a 
\series bold
\color brown
Routh Table
\series default
\color inherit
, and then interpreting it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Routh Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the following equivalent (closed-loop) transfer function, we will
 learn how to construct a routh-table for it.
 This routh table is used for the Routh-Hurwitz criterion.
 Figure 2.1 holds the initial layout for a Routh-Table, where we start in
 the row for the highest degree term and write every other term in the neighbour
ing columns.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G\left(s\right)=\frac{N\left(s\right)}{a_{4}s^{4}+a_{3}s^{3}+a_{2}s^{2}+a_{1}s+a_{0}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Completing the Routh-Table
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Routh-Table is completed through the repeated application of determinants.
 Recall the formula for the determinant of a 2x2 matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The Routh-Table uses the negative determinant, divided by the term in the
 row above, and the leftmost column.
 The completed routh-table looks like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Interpreting the Routh-Table
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we know how to make basic Routh-tables, we can look to learn how
 to interpret them.
 The way to interpret these tables is to look at the number of sign changes
 in the first-column.
 The number of sign changes in the first-column tell us the number of poles
 on the RHS of the s-plane.
 Knowing how many are on the RHS, we can use symmetry and the fundamental
 theorem of algebra to deduce the number on the LHS (having a sign change
 means the system is unstable).
 We might sometimes run into special cases when generating this table though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Routh-Table: Zero in the First Column
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we encounter a zero in only the first column, we replace it with a
 variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, which represents a very small positive or negative number.
 After we will get a table dependent on epsilon.
 We see what happens as epsilon goes to 0+ and 0- and count the sign changes
 for both cases.
 In both cases they should be the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Routh-Table: Entire Row of Zeroes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we encounter this the following entries need to be handles differently.
 In this case we go directly to the 
\series bold

 Using it to construct an

\color brown

\begin_inset Formula $s$

\begin_inset Formula $s$

 in that row.
 We then

 this polynomial, and use the new coefficients as the replacements for the

The row (and every row below) from which the auxilliary polynomial was construct
ed now corresponds with the auxilliary polynomial.
 This auxilliary polynomial is always an even polynomial and its roots will
 always have rotational symmetry about the origin.
 The rows above the ones for the aux polynomial are for the original function.
 Overall we add up every sign change once again to get the number of poles
 on the RHS of the complex plane.

\begin_layout Section
Formulating Error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a simple 
\series bold

unity-feedback
\series default
\color inherit
 control system with an open-loop transfer function of 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

, and closed-loop transfer function of 
\begin_inset Formula $T\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This system is shown in Figure 1.1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T\left(s\right)=\frac{G\left(s\right)}{1+G\left(s\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The error 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 in this control system would be the difference between the input 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 and output 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This gives us our first error formulation shown in Equation 1.1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(s\right)=R\left(s\right)-C\left(s\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To generate our next error formulation, consider that 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(s\right)=R\left(s\right)T\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The output is the input multiplied by the closed-loop transfer function.
 We can substitute this into Equation 1.1 to get our second error formulation
 in Equation 1.2
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(s\right)=R\left(s\right)\left[1-T\left(s\right)\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To arrive at our third formulation for error, consider the fact that the
 output is equal to the error times the open-loop transfer function, 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(s\right)=E\left(s\right)G\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We can substitute this into Equation 1.1 to get our third formulation in
 Equation 1.3
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(s\right)=\frac{R\left(s\right)}{1+G\left(s\right)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So far we have found three different formulations for error shown in Equations
 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.
 All of these formulations depend on the input 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

, but one depends on the output, another depends on the closed-loop transfer
 function, and the last depends on the open-loop transfer function.
 The error 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 is equal to each of the formulations below.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
R\left(s\right)-C\left(s\right) & \  & R\left(s\right)\left[1-T\left(s\right)\right] & \  & \frac{R\left(s\right)}{1+G\left(s\right)}\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
Steady-State-Error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although we can calculate the error at any time 
\begin_inset Formula $e\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 through the inverse laplace transform of the 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 function, we are more interested in the final value of the error, 
\begin_inset Formula $e\left(\infty\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We can easily find this out through final-value theorem.
 Which is given in Equation 1.4.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f\left(\infty\right)=\lim_{s\rightarrow0}sF\left(s\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Static Error-Constants & Steady-State Error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a step input applied to a unity-gain feedback system.
 If we apply this step input into Equation 1.3 we can get the following simplific
ation.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e_{\text{step}}\left(\infty\right)=\lim_{s\rightarrow0}\frac{s\left(1/s\right)}{1+G\left(s\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
e_{\text{step}}\left(\infty\right)=\frac{1}{1+\lim_{s\rightarrow0}G\left(s\right)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In order for the step response error at infinity to be equal to 0, we require
 our denominator to go to zero.
 This means that we require our limit (The DC-Gain of the open-loop transfer
 function) to go to infinity.
 If this condition is not met, we do not achieve a zero error at 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{DC Gain}=\lim_{s\rightarrow0}G\left(s\right)=\infty
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Although this limit is the DC-Gain, we define it as a value called the 
\series bold
\color brown
position-error constant 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{p}$
\end_inset


\series default
\color inherit
.
 In other words, we require our 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{p}=\infty$
\end_inset

 for a 0 steady state error from a step response.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
K_{p}=\lim_{s\rightarrow0}G\left(s\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline

We can do the exact same process for a ramp input 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1/s^{2}\right)$

\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
Satisfying the Error-Constant Conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can think of this as differentiating the open-loop transfer function
 (as differentiating is equivalent to multiplying by 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

).
 Which helps us remember the order of the 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 term in front of the open-loop transfer function.
 For their respective inputs each error constant needs to be equal to infinty
 to give a zero steady state error.
 If they are not equal to infinity, it means that the steady state error
 approaches some nonzero ratio (see Equation 1.5)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To satisfy this constraint, our open-loop transfer function needs to be
 of the form below.
 Our denominator needs to go to infinity, thus 
\series bold
\color brown
we require an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

'th order pole at the origin
\series default
\color inherit
, such that the limit approaches infinity at 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

.
 The system is also said to be a 
\series bold
\color brown
type-n system
\series default
\color inherit
.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G\left(s\right)=\frac{\left(s-z_{1}\right)\left(s-z_{2}\right)...\left(s-z_{n}\right)}{s^{n}\left(s-p_{1}\right)\left(s-p_{2}\right)...\left(s-p_{m}\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For the position-error constant, we require that 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq1$
\end_inset

.
 This means that we require at least a 1st order pole at the origin, and
 consequently at least one integration must be present in the forward path.
 For the velocity-error constant, we require that 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq2$
\end_inset

, as one of these will effectively be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cancelled out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in Equation 1.7, this means at least a 2nd order pole at the origin, and
 at least 2 integrations in the forward path.
 Similarly, for the acceleration-error constant, we require that n
\begin_inset Formula $\geq3$
\end_inset

, at least a 3rd order pole at the origin, and at least 3 integrations along
 the forward path.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Lets consider what happens if we do not satisfy these conditions.
 Consider a parabolic input with transform (
\begin_inset Formula $1/s^{3}$
\end_inset

).
 We require at least a 3rd order pole at the origin.
 Lets examine what happens with a 1st order and 2nd order pole at the origin
 instead.
 Let's start by considering a 1st order pole at the origin.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K_{a}=\lim_{s\rightarrow0}s^{2}\frac{\left(s-z_{1}\right)\left(s-z_{2}\right)...\left(s-z_{n}\right)}{s\left(s-p_{1}\right)\left(s-p_{2}\right)...\left(s-p_{m}\right)}=0
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When we have the error-constant go to 0, this implies that the steady-state
 error is infinite.

The poles of our closed-loop system are determined by the denominator of
 our transfer function and when it equals to 0, thus we define the denominator
 as the

) varies.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_inset Newline newline

One advantage of this approach is that we can obtain the location of closed-loop
 poles, without explicitly calculating them.
 Let's start our study by observing that a complex number 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is a pole of the closed-loop system if and only if equation 12.1 is satisfied.
 This equation follows from setting the characteristic equation equal to
 zero.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
KG\left(s\right)H\left(s\right)=-1
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We can rewrite equation 12.1 to show that in order for 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 to be a pole of the system, both equations, 12.2 and 12.3 must be satisfied.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|KG\left(s\right)H\left(s\right)\right|=1
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\angle KG\left(s\right)H\left(s\right)=180
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

An easy way to do this graphically is to consider some point 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}$
\end_inset

 on the complex plane and test if it is a zero of the closed-loop transfer
 function.
 From Figure 12.1 below, we can caculate the phase and magnitude given some
 point 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Here the 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 values are the length of the ray from the point 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}$
\end_inset

 to the pole/zero, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 values are the angle measures as shown in Figure 12.1
